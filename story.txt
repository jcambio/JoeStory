Once upon a time there was a frog named JimBob. JimBob was not happy because he did not have opposable thumbs. This did not allow him to code. JimBob went to a witch in order to recie opposable thumbs. The witch said he had to give up his most personal object. 

JimBob thought long and hard for a good 2 seconds. He decided that he would give up his favorite limited edition book: How to be a Toad. JimBob had finally accepted his identity and figured it wouldn't hurt him too much to give away that book. After he handed the witch his book, the witch revealed her true form. It was his evil twin, BobJim! *Pikachu meme* 

BobJim, a fan the theater, pulls out his cape and fog machine. He breaks into song, singing what sounds very similar to the plot of High School Musical 3. JimBob, not interested at all in his brother's theatrics walked away in search for the next wicked witch.
